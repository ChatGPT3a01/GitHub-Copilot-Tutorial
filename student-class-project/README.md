# Student Class Project

## Overview
This project is designed to demonstrate the implementation of a simple `Student` class in TypeScript. The `Student` class includes properties for a student's name and score, and serves as a foundational example for further development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- TypeScript

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd student-class-project
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Usage
To run the application, execute the following command:
```
npm start
```

This will compile the TypeScript files and run the application, demonstrating the functionality of the `Student` class.

## Future Enhancements
- Expand the `types/index.ts` file to include additional type definitions.
- Implement more features in the `Student` class, such as methods for calculating grades or displaying student information.
